#Read sourcefile

#Loop over every letter, (en/de)crypting the text; see 'cypher in python' on YT

#Loop over every word, checking for spelling exceptions, correcting; see 'Jackson Crawford' on YT

#Output to targetfile

#ROADMAP:
#Allow futhark distinctions as an argument input: -y for Y.F.; -a for A.S.F.; -e for E.F. via ON/OI/OE

#Write def functions() for each sub-language; inlcude Enlgish, OE, ON, OI texts; check versus dictionary database for easy-enough translations

#Recognize new words/definitions; cross-references online dictionaries/etymology/trasnlation-dictionaries; writes to database file, building new translations the more we use it. 
#Some tans-dicts already in GDrive (raw pdf); build out further with already-translated texts via online sources; cross-reference other translations (online if available; taken as input file??)
